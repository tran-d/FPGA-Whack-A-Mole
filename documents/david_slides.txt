3x3 whack-a-mole using LEDs (as moles) and capacitive sensors (as whacking detectors).

Moles have the following attributes:
Index, State, Time Elapsed, Time Limit On, Time Limit Off.

Index corresponds to LED index
State = inactive or active
Time Elapsed = time spent in current state
Time Limit On/Off = maximum amount of time spend on/off before switching states (pseudo-random number generator).


Points per whack = (Time Limit On) - (Time Elapsed)
Penalties for whacking an inactive mole. 
Score tracked in register.
