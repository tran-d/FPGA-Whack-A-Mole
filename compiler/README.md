# 350 Processor MIPS to Machine Code Script
The intructions.txt file is where you write a MIPS instruction on each line. When you run the script, it will take the MIPS instructions and create a .mif file with the name specified in the script. If you move the .mif file to your quartus project, your imem will run the instructions in the .mif file.

I believe every instruction should convert properly, but you may want to check that the proper machine code is produced yourself.

# Test Cases
If you can create different .mif files that test different functions like ALU, branching, jal, etc. that would be helpful to all of us. Also, if you can comment the expected output for data_writeReg wire or PC wire for each line, that would be helpful.
